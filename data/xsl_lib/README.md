xsltproc does not support XSLT 2.0. Actually there is quite a lack of free XSLT 2.0 tools, most of them are commercial.

EXSLT - Dates and Times 

This extension library was initially added so that the function date:date-time() could be used as a substitute for the built-in 2.0 function current-dateTime()

# Notes #
The version downloaded was modified slightly.
xsltproc does not like the spaces in the namespace definition. 
So
xmlns:date="http://exslt.org/dates and times"
was changed to 
xmlns:date="http://exslt.org/dates-and-times"
