Tallyman
========
---

Tallyman gathers data and generates a static website. It was built to generate [stats.preenandprune.com](http://stats.preenandprune.com) but it can be easily customized to generate your own page of [statistics porn](http://chartporn.com).

To generate the page you use a simple interface to a database which then generates the webpage.

Admin Interface => Database => Website 

Why?
-----------------------

I have been using [wodHub](http://wodhub.com/profiles/6534) for a while now to track my exercise data.  It's a free site and has expanded as a product sold to people running gyms. It's helped me track my gym benchmarks and kept me motivated to workout, and for that I am thankful. But like many free web applications it has a subtle issue.  You don't own your data. The person that is paying to run that site and letting you use it owns your data.  It's free to use but the hidden cost is that you lose ownership of your data.  If the individual who is running wodHub goes bankrupt tomorrow and the server gets shut down then all the data that you've input over time disappers.

This concern was compounded by the fact that some of the main bench mark names changed unexpectedly.  A benchmark workout called Cindy which was unexplicably renamed to "Cindy with a twist", and the "Max Deadlift" benchmark got renamed to "Deadlift Couplet".  The deadlift data also got reinterpreted as a timed workout instead of a max load workout so my data no longer made any sense.

I sent an email to the owner of the site which eventually got the deadlift data fixed, but never bothered to get the name of Cindy fixed.

But this begged the question as to how the data got changed in the first place?  Obviously the change was not intentional.  Most likely it was a side effect of giving paying users higher admin privileges to edit workout names which unintentionally allowed someone to modify a globally defined workout.  Worst case is that someone found a bug in the web application and maliciously changed the data through a security hole.

The issue of not being able to export your data is an intentional design to retain users and create lock-in. Theoretically you have access to all your data so you can copy it manually, however, the more data you've input into a site, the more monumental a task this becomes to move. The web was not always a place where companies creating walled gardens was so common and accepted.

> "In the early part of this century, if you made a service that let users create or share content, the expectation was that they could easily download a full-fidelity copy of their data, or import that data into other competitive services, with no restrictions. Vendors spent years working on interoperability around data exchange purely for the benefit of their users, despite theoretically lowering the barrier to entry for competitors."

There has been a creeping awareness of this issue of data ownership as we continue to input more and more of our lives into these web applications.  Google has a [data liberation](http://www.dataliberation.org/) website.  [App.net](https://join.app.net/) although not free, is a reaction to twitter changing their API rules.  One of their core values is "You own your content". 

Sometimes your data isn't important, like many of the banal things posted on facebook and twitter, but you should own the data that is important to you.

My workout data is important to me so I've decided to write some software and retain ownership. 

Technical Details
--------------

Tallyman consists of a simple curses interface to an sqlite database and a script to extract that data to an XML format.  The XML is then converted to HTML with an XML style sheet (XSL).

![Admin Interface] (http://mcormier.github.com/tallyman/images/ncurses.gif )

Ruby + curses => SQLite => Ruby => XML data => xsltproc => HTML page


A curses interface was chosen to: 

1. Avoid creating a web-based CGI admin interface 
2. Keep the project scope small
3. Make rapid interface development possible

Theoretically no admin interface is necessary, you could simply connect to the database manually and insert the data by handcrafting SQL, and then run a script to regenerate the website. This isn't convenient though, and eventually even the most determined user would mostly forgoe such a process due to the inconvenience of contintually handcrafting SQL.

The final implementation is smoking fast.



Design Pros and Cons
====================

Pros
----
1. You own your own data.
2. You can format the presentation of the data any way you like.
3. Log anything you want. Number of coffees per day if that's what floats your boat.
4. No possibility of a CGI security exploit since there is no web-based form interface.


Cons
----
1. Requires an intial investment to setup and configure.  It's not as simple as filling out a web from with your name and email address.
2. User must be comfortable with running a command line interface to input their data
3. Custom formating the webpage requires knowledge of HTML and CSS
4. Customization requires knowledge of SQL and basic scripting
5. Technical nature of the design limits it to intermediate to advance users.

Requirements
--------------
1. Ruby 1.9.1 or greater
2. SQLite 3
3. xsltcproc


Configuration
-------------
1. Create your SQLite database with data/createDatabase.sh
2. Copy config/config.properties.example to config.properties
3. Modify the filenames in the configuration file as appropriate
4. Run the command main bin/tallyman command

The current look of http://stats.preenandprune.com was heavily influenced, pretty much a direct copy of, Nicholas Feltron's [2006 annual report](http://feltron.com/ar06_01.html).

An alternative to setting up your own tallyman is to use [Daytum](http://daytum.com/) which does allow you to export your data as a CSV.  Daytum is free for the first 1000 items you log, they charge $4 a month if you require more space.
