Tallyman
========
---

Tallyman gathers data and generates a static website. It was built to generate [stats.preenandprune.com](http://stats.preenandprune.com) but it can be easily customized to generate your own page.

To generate the page you use an admin interface to a database which then generates or regenerates a webpage.

Admin Interface => Database => Website 

Why did you build this?
-----------------------

I have been using [wodhub](http://wodhub.com/profiles/6534) for a while now to track my exercise data.  It's a free site.


Own your data.

Why static?  PHP security holes/ Why regenerate the website if no data has changed?
